\title{COMPASS (Combinatorial Polyfunctionality Analysis of Single-Cells)}
\description{
This package implements a model for the analysis of polyfunctionality
in single-cell cytometry experiments. The model effectively
identifies combinations of markers that are differentially expressed
between samples of cells subjected to different stimulations.
