\title{Plot a COMPASSResult}
\usage{
\method{plot}{COMPASSResult}(x, y, subset = NULL, threshold = 0.01,
  minimum_dof = 1, maximum_dof = Inf, must_express = NULL, row_annotation,
  palette = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(10, "Purples"))(20),
  show_rownames = FALSE, show_colnames = FALSE, measure = NULL,
  order_by = FunctionalityScore, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{COMPASSResult}.}

\item{y}{This argument gets passed to \code{row_annotation}, if
\code{row_annotation} is missing. It can be used to group rows (individuals)
by different conditions as defined in the metadata.}

\item{subset}{An \R expression, evaluated within the metadata, used to
determine which individuals should be kept.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric threshold for filtering under-expressed
categories. Any categories with mean score < \code{threshold} are
removed.}

\item{minimum_dof}{The minimum degree of functionality for the categories
to be plotted.}

\item{maximum_dof}{The maximum degree of functionality for the categories
to be plotted.}

\item{must_express}{A character vector of markers that should be included
in each subset plotted. For example, \code{must_express=c("TNFa & IFNg")}
says we include only subsets that are positive for either
\code{TNFa} or \code{IFNg}, while \code{must_express=c("TNFa", "IFNg")}
says we should keep subsets which are positive for either \code{TNFa} or
\code{IFNg}.}

\item{row_annotation}{A vector of names, pulled from the metadata, to be
used for row annotation.}

\item{palette}{The colour palette to be used.}

\item{show_rownames}{Boolean; if \code{TRUE} we display row names (ie,
the individual ids).}

\item{show_colnames}{Boolean; if \code{TRUE} we display column names
(ie, the column name associated with a cytokine; typically not needed)}

\item{measure}{Optional. By default, we produce a heatmap of the mean
gammas produced in a model fit. We can override this by supplying a
matrix of suitable dimension as well; these can be generated with
the \code{Posterior*} functions -- see \code{\link{Posterior}} for
examples.}

\item{order_by}{Order rows within a group. This should be a function;
e.g. \code{FunctionalityScore}, \code{mean}, \code{median}, and so on.
Set this to \code{NULL} to preserve the original ordering of the data.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments passed to \code{pheatmap}.}
}
\value{
The plot as a \code{grid} object (\code{grob}). It can be redrawn
with e.g. \code{grid::grid.draw()}.
}
\description{
This function can be used to visualize the mean probability of response --
that is, the probability that there is a difference in response between
samples subjected to the 'treatment' condition, and samples subjected
to the 'control' condition.
}
\examples{
## visualize the mean probability of reponse
plot(CR)

## visualize the proportion of cells belonging to a category
plot(CR, measure=PosteriorPs(CR))
