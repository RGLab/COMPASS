Description: COMPASS is a statistical framework that enables unbiased analysis
    of antigen-specific T-cell subsets. COMPASS uses a Bayesian hierarchical
    framework to model all observed cell-subsets and select the most likely
    to be antigen-specific while regularizing the small cell counts that often
    arise in multi-parameter space. The model provides a posterior probability
    of specificity for each cell subset and each sample, which can be used to
    profile a subject's immune response to external stimuli such as infection
    or vaccination.
